# What is FatWatch?

FatWatch is weight-tracking software designed for iOS (that is, for iPhone,
iPad, and iPod touch). It is based on the methodology described by John
Walker in his book, The Hacker's Diet.

Because water makes up a significant portion of the human body, weighing
yourself once a day yields very "noisy" data, and the seemingly random up
and down fluctuations can be very frustrating to a person trying hard to
lose weight.

FatWatch solves this problem by computing a moving average of your weight
measurements, producing a trend line that greatly reduces the noise. From
the slope of this line, it also computes the equivalent number of food
calories. If you are planning your meals, you can use this information to
adjust your plans.

The Hacker's Diet is available at <http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/>.

# How do I install it on my iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch?

You can get FatWatch one of two ways: obtain a copy of the source code and
build and install it yourself using Apple's Developer Tools, or buy a copy
on the App Store.

The source code is available at <https://github.com/heroic-software/FatWatch>.
Note that if you aren't already a member of Apple's Developer Program, you
will need to become a member in order to install FatWatch onto an Apple
device.

FatWatch is sold on the App Store for US$4.99 or the equivalent in your local
currency.

# Why buy if I can get the source code for free?

If you're not a software developer, you will probably find it easier to buy
it on the App Store. The proceeds are used to maintain the Apple Developer
Program membership ($100/year) and maintain the website www.fatwatchapp.com.
If FatWatch happens to generate excess profits, they will be donated to the
Free Software Foundation <https://www.fsf.org/about/>.

# Is it legal to sell GPL-licensed software on the App Store?

Only if certain conditions are met.

Any entity distributing software under the terms of the GNU General Public
License may not impose further restrictions on the user's rights. Apple,
however, does just that, via the App Store Terms of Service, which a user
must agree to in order to obtain software through the App Store.

However, the GPL does not prohibit the copyright holder (in this case,
Heroic Software Inc) to simultaneously offer the software to specific
entities under a different license. Such a "dual licensing" strategy is
not unusual.

Basically, as copyright holder, Heroic Software Inc is granting Apple
permission to distribute FatWatch under an agreement separate from the
GPL. Unless you also have a separate agreement, you must abide by the
terms of the GPL; you cannot distribute your own version of FatWatch
through the App Store. (Source code distribution is still OK, however.)
